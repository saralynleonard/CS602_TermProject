# About CosmicQuarry
CosmicQuarry is a crowdfunding application intended to connect users interested in staking asteroid and other planetary mining claims. 
CosmicQuarry will use user investments to help fund space mining missions. After the mission is complete, users will receive a return on their investment(s) depending on how much/what material was mined and the price the material was sold for.
